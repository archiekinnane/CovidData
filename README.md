# CovidData

'covid_g' is a Python graphing package that can be used to track Covid-19's spread in any state or county in the United States. Most of what is in this package can also be accessed without Python at archiekinnane.pythonanywhere.com.

See tutorial for how to use this package in a Jupyter Notebook. If you're having path issues, an easy trick is to put the covid_g package in the same directory as something that you have no problem importing into python, like numpy.
