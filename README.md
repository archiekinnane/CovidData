# CovidData
Graphing tools for tracking Covid-19's spread. Most of what is in this package can also be seen without Python at archiekinnane.pythonanywhere.com.

See tutorial for how to use this package in a Jupyter Notebook. If you're having path issues, an easy trick is to put the covid_g package in the same directory as something that you have no problem importing into python, like numpy.
